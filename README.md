# About The Project

A small Django project I wrote for a Take-Home Assignment that mimics the clothing inventory of an online clothing shop. The clothing items include 5 categories of clothing (Shirts, Jackets, Pants...etc), 10 tag descriptors (Athletic, Casual, Wool...etc), and 20 clothing products).

The UI is a simple Django HTML template that allows users to search for products by description, filter by tags, filter by categories, or any combination of these filters. 

# Set-up

## 1) Clone & create virtualenv



# Additional Notes

For clarity, I used ChatGPT to help come up with the sample data of 20 clothing products, but not for the actual code. Likewise, I used Github Copilot for simple HTML formatting, specifically for the <fieldset> and <legend> portion of product_list.html.
